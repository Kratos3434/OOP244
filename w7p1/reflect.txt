I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor
provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

Upon completing this workshop, I have learned the concepts of inheritance by implementing a 
base class and a derived class. In this workshop the base class was the MemberParliament class and the 
derived class was the Minister class. I inherited the public functions of the MemberParliament class by 
doing “class Minister:public MemberParliament”. By inhertiting the MemberParliament class I can easily 
do the write function without implementing another code by just simply putting the write function of 
the MemberParliament class to the Minister class and I did the same with the read function and just 
added a few lines of codes needed for the Minister read and write functions. An example from my code:  

std::ostream& Minister::write(std::ostream& os) const{ 

	  //| [ID] | [age] | [DISTRICT] | [PM] / [Year Assumed Office] 

	  MemberParliament::write(os); 

	  os <<" | " << m_ministerName << "/" << m_year; 

	  return os; 

    } 

As you can see the number of lines of codes have greatly reduced due to inheritance.
