I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor
provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

The topics that I have learned upon completing this workshop is that I learned how to 
create a class and name an object. I have learned that you can create different objects
and define data and functions into the same class and that I can set these data private or
public. In the workshop, what we did was encapsulation where we made the variables private
while we made the functions public so that we cannot modify the values of a class outside 
of the class. I have also learned how to manipulate data, like set a double variable to 
one decimal places. The most difficult part for me in the workshop is the add function. I
overcame the problem by testing and debugging the function until I solved it.
