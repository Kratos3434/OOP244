I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor
provided to complete my workshops and assignments.
*/

	The topics that I have learned upon completing this workshop is that I have learned how to 
implement a copy constructor, a copy constructor basically copies an object like for example in 
workshop 6 part 2, Basket::Basket(const Basket& basket) { 

	  setEmpty(); 

	  (*this) = basket; 

    } 

I have also learned how to implement a copy assignment operator which is the same as the copy 
constructor. I set the object’s value equal to the value of the object that I want to copy. Here is a copy 
assignment operator that I implemented in workshop 6 part 2, Basket& Basket::operator=(const 
Basket& basket) { 

	  deallocate(); 

	  m_fruits = new Fruit[basket.m_cnt]; 

	  m_cnt = basket.m_cnt; 

	  for (int i = 0; i < m_cnt; i++) 

		m_fruits[i] = basket.m_fruits[i]; 

	  m_price = basket.m_price; 

	  return *this; 

  

    } 

The workshop was straightforward and our professor explained the workshop very well that I didn’t sort 
of encounter any major problems or difficulty in the workshop.
