The topics I have learned upon completing this workshop is that I have learned how to allocate memory 
to an array of struct and to an array of characters. I have also learned how to deallocate memory so that 
the allocated memories that I allocated to the arrays are released back to the computer’s RAM. The 
difficulty that I encountered was coding the readBirthDate function. It was difficult because it’s not like
in c that the length of the array is already declared. I solved it with the help of our professor, he helped 
us how to count the number of records matched. The hard part was to store the values into the array 
which I was able to solve earlier. What I did was I read the values using local variables while fscanf is not 
equal to –1 and “i” is not equal to the number of matches and I stored the read data to the array of 
struct Employee. Here is the code or the solution that I did: 

while (fscanf(fptr, "%[^,],%d/%d/%d\n", name,&m, &d, &y) !=-1 && i<matches) { 

		    if (m==month) { 

				employees[i].name = new char[strlen(name) + 1]; 

				strcpy(employees[i].name, name); 

				employees[i].month = m; 

				employees[i].day = d; 

				employees[i].year = y; 

				i++; 

				ok = true; 

		    } 

		}
