I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor
provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

The topics that I have learned upon completing this workshop is that I learned how to implement and
declare an operator. It basically allows us to use operators such as addition, subtraction, plus equals, 
minus equals, and logical operators on objects depending on how you implement it, for example, in 
workshop 5 part 2 I can subtract the power level by implementing an operator overload function and 
there I put power level minus equals to the number I want to subtract. I can also overload the output 
stream or ostream so that I can print the results on the console without using cout. The most difficult 
part in the workshop is the plus equals operator where I have to add and increase the size of the array 
and add a power to the power list, I solved it by creating a temporary power object array and I stored 
the values of the existing list of powers and then I increased the number of powers and I stored again 
the values of temp back to the list of powers and I added the new power to the list and also updated the 
power level.
